# Discord programmer vacancies finder

## General description

This bot was created to help you find programmer vacancies on [HeadHunter.ru](https://hh.ru/).\
If you are a rookie programmer, it will also help you get acquainted with discord.py and pandas.

## Creating an account

To create your discord profile you need to visit [discord websote](https://discord.com/). Here you can download their app
or straight go to creating your account by clicking on top right button 'login'. Instead of logging you need to click 'Register' and finally create your account.

After you did everything above, your next step is to create a testing area. You need to locate '+' sign in the left bottom corner.
Then you should follow this sequence: Click '+' -> 'Create my Own' -> 'For me and my friends' -> Name it and click on the blue button.
You've just created your first discord server!

## Creating a bot

To create a discord bot you should visit a [developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\
Here you just need to create an application by simply clicking on the button "New application".\
After that is done, you need to go to the bot tab and then click on the button called "Add bot".

After you created you first discord bot, you have to copy its token and save it somewhere, so nobody can see it.

To invite your bot to the server, simply go to the tab called "0Auth2", then go to the "URL Generator" tab, 
click on the square next to the bot, and finally just copy a link. After that, just paste it in your browser and bot will automatically join the server you chose.

## Installation

1. First of all, you have to download all files on your personal computer. The code runs on python 3,
 which you can download on [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 
2. After successful installation you will have to download some libraries for your bot.\
You should run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal and it will automatically install everything.
    
3. You are almost done! Now you just need to create a file called *token.txt* and there you will put a token from your bot.


## Automation using heroku

There is a lot of ways how to automate your discord bot, but I found the easiest and the most effective variant.

1. The first step is creating an account on the platform called [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. After you created your account, click on the top right button "New" and then "Create a new app". Here you just need to give your app a unique name.
3. Once you did that, you will have to download [heroku git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and then go to the "Deploy" tab.
4. Here you just have to follow the instructions to successfully automate your bot. If you need some additional commands, just scroll down a page where you downloaded heroku git.
